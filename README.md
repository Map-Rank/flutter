## Installation Instruction

In order to run and use this project on your devices you need to fulfill the prerequisites and dependencies required below.

## Prerequisites
1. Get a powerful machine that will allow you to emulate an android, ios  device or both.( <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile">Visit this link for more enhancement</a>)
2. Set up Android Studio or VScode on your device.

  **Android Studio** is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Based on the powerful code editor and developer tools from IntelliJ IDEA , Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps, such as:

  - A flexible Gradle-based build system
  - A fast and feature-rich emulator
  - A unified environment where you can develop for all Android devices
  - Live Edit to update composables in emulators and physical devices in real time
  - Code templates and GitHub integration to help you build common app features and import sample code
  - Extensive testing tools and frameworks
  - Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems 
  - C++ and NDK support
  - Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, making it easy to integrate Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwu-63BhC9ARIsAMMTLXS-TmNcoT4ZiWnqnuCSflz4bGjSkWJ_lHEI2ibGazx5kb0YgqvnsssaAon8EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Download Android Studio here</a>

  **Visual Studio Code**, also commonly referred to as VS Code,  is an integrated development environment developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality. VScode offers a wide range of advantages that are:
  - Code in any language
  - Some key features include Git integration, debugging tools, and extensions that allow you to customize your workflow.
  - Large Community environment
  - Fast and efficient: Visual Studio Code is fast and efficient, with a small footprint.
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Download Visual Studio Code here</a>

In the case you have been used to VSCode and your working machine is not really powerful, VScode is a better choice but you have to have a good knowledge with dealing with extensions.
Android Studio is suitable for powerful machine, that do not deal with fast and efficiency concerns and ease the environment installation process.

## Troubleshooting

In case your flutter version is 3.16 or posterior to version 3.16, you might be facing issues with your graddle files and your project will not run. <a href ="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78032396/applying-flutters-app-plugin-loader-gradle-plugin-imperatively-using-the-apply-s)">Follow this link to solve the issue</a>
After following the instructions on the link above you might need to delete the following from your graddle file because Gradle wrapper already has it:
task clean(type: Delete) {
delete rootProject.buildDir
}

## Testing

Testing is a crucial aspect of the development process, ensuring that the code is robust and behaves as expected.
In the Residat project, we employ the native test package designed by the flutter team for our testing framework, providing an efficient and feature-rich environment for both unit and integration testing. Below is a summary of the current test coverage and details about the testing setup and examples.

### Test Setup
Flutter provides a native library that allows you to run your test; but in order to generate a tangible report of all the lines covered by your test you need to implement the following steps:
- you need to install the coverage library in your project at the root of your project using the command: flutter pub add coverage
- To generate the report you may run in your terminal the command **flutter test --coverage**(that report will be generated into a file called lcov.info )

the lcov.info file does not provide ready to exploit information, so we'll be using some commands to generate a html readable report that will allow us to read our report.
1. On a Windows System
- Paste the content of your lcov file into .txt file and run the following Python Script
  reading_file = open("coverage.txt", "r")

new_file_content = ""
for line in reading_file:
stripped_line = line.strip()
new_line = stripped_line.replace("\\", "/")
new_file_content += new_line +"\n"
reading_file.close()

writing_file = open("coverage.txt", "w")
writing_file.write(new_file_content)
writing_file.close()
- paste back the content of your .txt file into your lcov.info file
- run the following command: **wsl genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/** (Assuming you have a Windows sublinux System installed on your machine)

2. On a Linux System
- Just directly run the command **genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/**

### Test Coverage Summary
Our test coverage is actually at 57% representing the percentage of lines covered by our test.
